/**
 * A stage member track is a track,
 * that has been published and assigned to the related stage member.
 * So all other stage members will receive this track.
 *
 * Important: a track can point to an ov-based track or an webrtc-based producer (!)
 *
 * However, spatial audio settings are stored for both,
 * maybe for integrating webrtc and ov later and use
 * the web audio api panner for 3D audio interpolation later.
